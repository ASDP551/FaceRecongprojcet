Introduction
This face recognition system is built using data science techniques. It uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) for training a deep learning model on labeled face datasets. The system utilizes libraries like OpenCV and TensorFlow for image processing and model training.

System Architecture
The system consists of the following main components:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Detect and crop faces using OpenCV.
Normalize, resize, and augment the images.
Model Training:
Use a pretrained CNN model (VGG16) with custom layers for face recognition.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data Collection
Sources: Public datasets (e.g., LFW, CelebA, VGGFace) or custom dataset.
Tools: OpenCV for face detection.
Data Preprocessing
Face Detection: Using OpenCVâ€™s Haar cascades to detect and crop faces.
Normalization: Scale pixel values to [0, 1] or [-1, 1].
Resizing: Resize images to a uniform size (224x224).
Data Augmentation: Use techniques like rotation, scaling, and flipping to enhance dataset diversity.

Model Selection
Base Model: VGG16 pretrained on ImageNet.
Custom Layers: Additional dense and dropout layers for fine-tuning.
Transfer Learning
Freeze the initial layers of the VGG16 model.
Train only the custom layers to adapt to the new dataset.
